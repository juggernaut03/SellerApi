## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the following in `.env`:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - A secure random string for JWT signing
- `CLOUDINARY_*` - Your Cloudinary credentials (for file uploads)

### 3. Create First Admin User

Since there's no public signup, you need to create the first admin user. Use the provided script:

```bash
npm run create-admin
```

The script will prompt you for:
- Admin name
- Admin email
- Admin password (min 6 characters)

**Alternative: Manual creation in MongoDB**

If you prefer to create the admin manually:

```javascript
// Connect to your MongoDB and run this in MongoDB shell or Compass
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "Admin User",
  email: "admin@example.com",
  password: "$2a$10$YourHashedPasswordHere", // Use bcrypt to hash your password
  role: "admin",
  permissions: ["inventory", "shipments", "finance", "defects"],
  isActive: true,
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
})
```

To hash your password:

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const password = 'your-password';
bcrypt.hash(password, 10).then(hash => console.log(hash));
```

### 4. Run the Server

Development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production mode:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured PORT)
